        <!--Notes: This page is just an introduction. 
        It is also the best way to analyze the structure of the project.
        This page is the index.html and the CSS page is on the same folder as main.css
        The nav elements (menu options) are loded from /assets/nav.js using JQuery 
        and they work for any of the projects in this page as long as the main page for the project
        is included in this file.

        For more information, check the nav.js file comments.
